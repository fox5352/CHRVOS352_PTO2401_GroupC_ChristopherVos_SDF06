in this project i created a simplified version of an instagram profile page this project focuses in layout with css and responsiveness

### Reflections

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: I can use both flexbox and grid with confidence as tools in my projects
- **Responsive Design**: I have the page responsive and self adjusting to match all screen sizes
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style the profile image, user information, and gallery section effectively, closely resembling an Instagram profile.

#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: the instagram pages div's are setup differently so i couldn't come copy it so i hade to make my own
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: I enjoyed creating thehover effect

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I would like to practice the grid layout more
- **Code Optimization**: my code looks messy i would like to try and do more in less selectors
- **Creative Design Choices**: I adhered closely to the Instagram layout for practice but would like to experiment with more creative design choices in future projects.

#### Overall Learning Experience
